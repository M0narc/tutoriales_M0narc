Data structures: a named location that can be used to store and organize data

example: a family tree! is a hierarchy of family relationships

an array: is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory location
char[] array; 'h''e''l''l''o'

algorithm: a collection of steps to solve a problem
ex: baking a pizza
    1. heat the oven to 550Â°F
    2. knead the dough
    3. add toppings
    etc.

a linear search is another ex
a linear search one by one, examine the elements of an array
to find a value

why learn DS and algorithm?
    1. you'll write code that is both time and memory efficient
    2. commonly asked questions involve DS&A in coding job interviews
